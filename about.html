<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Amar Singh, and I hail from Ayodhya. I come from a background where education wasn't given much importance, but my father took up the challenge and decided to prioritize my studies. I, too, resolved to make something of myself. I began preparing for entrance exams for prestigious schools like Navodaya and Vidyagyan, which offered full scholarships, knowing that without one, pursuing my studies would be difficult. Fortunately, I was selected to attend Vidyagyan School in Sitapur, located in Lucknow, and commenced my studies there in 2015, starting from the 6th grade.</p>

<p>Vidyagyan School is entirely funded by Shiv Nadar, the chairman of HCL Company. During my time at Vidyagyan, I experienced a transformative journey. I developed confidence and acquired proficiency in the English language, which was a challenge for me coming from a rural background. To overcome this, I actively engaged in various activities such as hosting assemblies, participating in webinars, and joining discussions to enhance my confidence and communication skills. This experience paved the way for my success.</p>

In 10th grade, I achieved an impressive 97% score, which motivated me to pursue the science stream. In 12th grade, I secured 92% marks. To pursue my undergraduate studies, I applied for scholarships at Vidyashilp University, located in Bengaluru. Fortunately, I received a 100% scholarship for a B.Tech. in Data Science (Honors) program.</p>

<p>Currently, I am pursuing my BTech.in  Data Science (Honors) and actively seeking scholarships for my higher studies at foreign universities. Additionally, I am dedicating my time to learning web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey and aspirations.</p>
